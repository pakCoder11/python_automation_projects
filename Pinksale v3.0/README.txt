Pinksale Project Trending Bot - Python
-------------------------------------------

Pinksale is a website to create token and launch it on few clicks. On this website trending was a big issues for developers they wannt to make their project trends on Pinksale platform. So for that reason I develop a bot to make project trend on Pinksale. 

This bot was developed in Python 3.10+, it uses HTTPs proxies for redirecting through various IP addresses. This make your project trend on Pinksale. For running a bot you need to purchase a set of proxies from proxy selling sites like https://www.webshare.io/. The bot opens multiple windows and perform link clicking operation on each thread. It uses Asynchrounous multi-threading mechanism. 

=====================
HOW TO USE THE BOT
=====================
- As explained in video but I would like to highlight steps for running
- load the list of poxies to Text Document proxies.txt 
- load the variables into data.json file 
   (1) chromedriver_path 
   (2) windows_per_thread (number of windows open per thread)
   (3) project_link 

- Run the bot through python command

This application was purely developed for selling, I do not create any repo on GitHub for this script. If you want this script then you can contact to me on social media.
